# PSS Status Mark System Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the PSS (Protocol Scoring System) status mark system to make it more robust, reliable, and feature-rich. The system now provides advanced event recognition, validation, and analysis capabilities.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Event Recognition System

#### Improved Status Determination
- **Dynamic Event Type Lookup**: Events are now validated against the database's event type registry
- **Protocol Version Tracking**: Each event is tagged with the protocol version used for parsing
- **Confidence Scoring**: Parser confidence is calculated based on validation results
- **Multi-level Status**: Events can be marked as 'recognized', 'unknown', 'partial', or 'deprecated'

#### Robust Validation Framework
- **Rule-based Validation**: Events are validated against configurable rules stored in the database
- **Multiple Validation Types**: Support for range, format, data type, required field, and custom validation
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed validation errors are stored for analysis
- **Performance Monitoring**: Processing time is tracked for each event

### 2. Database Schema Enhancements

#### New Tables Added (Migration 8)
- **`pss_event_recognition_history`**: Tracks status changes over time
