# Atoms

This folder contains the smallest, most reusable UI elements in the application (e.g., buttons, icons, text fields, labels, etc.).

- Atoms should be stateless, styleable, and composable.
- Add new atom components here as needed.

If this folder is empty, it means no atomic UI elements have been extracted yet. Review your UI for opportunities to create reusable atoms.
