# OBS WebSocket Migration Plan: Custom Implementation to obws Crate

## Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for migrating from our current custom OBS WebSocket implementation (using `tokio-tungstenite`) to the native Rust `obws` crate (version 0.14.0). This migration aims to address existing problems with the current implementation and leverage the benefits of a mature, type-safe OBS WebSocket library.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Problems with Current Custom Implementation

1. **Complex Connection Management**: Manual WebSocket connection handling with custom reconnection logic
2. **Custom JSON Handling**: Manual serialization/deserialization of OBS WebSocket messages
3. **Inconsistent Error Propagation**: Mixed error handling patterns across different operations
4. **Limited Type Safety**: Runtime errors due to manual JSON parsing
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Custom implementation requires ongoing maintenance and updates
6. **Potential Race Conditions**: Complex async state management without proper synchronization

### Current Architecture
- **Backend**: Custom `tokio-tungstenite` WebSocket client
- **Message Handling**: Manual JSON parsing and response mapping
- **Error Handling**: Mixed `AppError` and custom error types
- **Connection Management**: Custom reconnection and heartbeat logic

1. **Full OBS WebSocket v5 Support**: Complete implementation of OBS WebSocket protocol v5
2. **Type-Safe API**: Compile-time guarantees for request/response types
3. **Built-in Connection Management**: Automatic connection handling and reconnection
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper error types and propagation
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built-in event subscription and handling
6. **Active Maintenance**: Regular updates and community support
7. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient async implementation using Tokio
