# OBS WebSocket Migration Plan: Custom Implementation to obws Crate

## Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for migrating from our current custom OBS WebSocket implementation (using `tokio-tungstenite`) to the native Rust `obws` crate (version 0.14.0). This migration aims to address existing problems with the current implementation and leverage the benefits of a mature, type-safe OBS WebSocket library.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Problems with Current Custom Implementation

1. **Complex Connection Management**: Manual WebSocket connection handling with custom reconnection logic
2. **Custom JSON Handling**: Manual serialization/deserialization of OBS WebSocket messages
3. **Inconsistent Error Propagation**: Mixed error handling patterns across different operations
4. **Limited Type Safety**: Runtime errors due to manual JSON parsing
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Custom implementation requires ongoing maintenance and updates
6. **Potential Race Conditions**: Complex async state management without proper synchronization

### Current Architecture
- **Backend**: Custom `tokio-tungstenite` WebSocket client
- **Message Handling**: Manual JSON parsing and response mapping
- **Error Handling**: Mixed `AppError` and custom error types
- **Connection Management**: Custom reconnection and heartbeat logic

2. **Type-Safe API**: Compile-time guarantees for request/response types
3. **Built-in Connection Management**: Automatic connection handling and reconnection
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper error types and propagation
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built-in event subscription and handling
6. **Active Maintenance**: Regular updates and community support
7. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient async implementation using Tokio

## Rollback Plan

### Feature Flag Rollback
The implementation uses feature flags (`obs-legacy` and `obs-obws`) to enable gradual migration and easy rollback:

cargo build --features obs-legacy

# Use new obws implementation
cargo build --features obs-obws

# Use both for testing
cargo build --features obs-legacy,obs-obws
```

### Code Rollback
1. **Keep old implementation**: The old `obs/` module remains intact

## Conclusion

The migration to the `obws` crate represents a significant improvement in our OBS WebSocket integration. The current implementation provides a solid foundation with basic operations working correctly. The use of feature flags ensures a safe, gradual migration with easy rollback capabilities.

The next phase focuses on implementing the custom request system and event handling to achieve full feature parity with the current implementation while maintaining the benefits of the type-safe, well-maintained `obws` crate.
