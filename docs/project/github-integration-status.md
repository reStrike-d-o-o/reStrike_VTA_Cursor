## 📋 **PROJECT BOARD SETUP**

### **⚠️ Manual Setup Required**
GitHub has deprecated the classic Projects API, so the project board needs to be set up manually:

#### **Step 1: Create New Project Board**
1. Go to: https://github.com/damjanZGB/reStrike_VTA_Cursor/projects
2. Click "New project"
3. Select "Board" layout
4. Name: "reStrike VTA Development"
5. Description: "Production-ready Windows desktop application for taekwondo instant video replay"

#### **Step 2: Create Columns**
Set up the following 6 columns in order:
1. **🗂️ Backlog** - Future planned tasks
2. **📋 Todo** - Ready to start, dependencies met  
3. **🔄 In Progress** - Currently being worked on
4. **👀 Review** - Awaiting review or testing
5. **✅ Done** - Completed tasks
6. **🚫 Blocked** - Blocked by external dependencies

#### **Step 3: Add Issues to Project**
1. Go to the Issues tab: https://github.com/damjanZGB/reStrike_VTA_Cursor/issues
2. Add each of the 18 created issues to the project board
3. Place immediate priority tasks (#6-#10) in "Todo" column
4. Place infrastructure tasks (#11-#15) in "Backlog" column  
5. Place documentation tasks (#16-#17) in "Backlog" column
6. Place enhancement epics (#18-#23) in "Backlog" column

#### **Step 4: Configure Automation**
1. Set up automated workflows in project settings
2. Configure status synchronization with issue labels
3. Set up milestone tracking for Phase 1 (Testing), Phase 2 (Production), Phase 3 (Enhancements)
