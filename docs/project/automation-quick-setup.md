2. **Name**: `PAT_TOKEN`
3. **Value**: Your GitHub Personal Access Token
4. Click **"Add secret"**

### **1.3 PAT Token Requirements**
Your token needs these permissions:
- ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
- ✅ `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)
- ✅ `delete:packages` (Delete packages from GitHub Package Registry)

## 🔧 **Step 2: Configure Project Board Workflows**

### **2.1 Navigate to Project Settings**
- **URL**: https://github.com/users/damjanZGB/projects/3/settings/workflows
- **Purpose**: Configure automation for the project board

### **2.2 Enable Automation**
1. **Issue Status Updates**: Enable automatic status changes
2. **Project Board Sync**: Enable board synchronization
3. **Automatic Labeling**: Enable label assignment
4. **Status Transitions**: Enable workflow status updates

### **2.3 Configure Workflow Rules**
- **When issues are created**: Add to "📋 Todo" column
- **When issues are labeled**: Update status based on labels
- **When issues are closed**: Move to "✅ Done" column
- **When PRs are opened**: Add to "🔄 In Progress" column

## 🔧 **Step 3: Test Automation**

### **3.1 Create Test Issue**
1. Go to: https://github.com/reStrike-d-o-o/reStrike_VTA_Cursor/issues/new
2. Use template: "Task"
3. Title: "Test Automation Setup"
4. Body: "Testing automation configuration"
5. Click "Submit new issue"

### **3.2 Verify Automation**
- ✅ Issue automatically added to project board
- ✅ Appropriate labels applied
- ✅ Status set to "📋 Todo"

### **3.3 Test Status Changes**
1. Edit the test issue
2. Add label: `status:in-progress`
3. Verify issue moves to "🔄 In Progress" column
4. Close the issue
5. Verify issue moves to "✅ Done" column

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **PAT Token Not Working**
- **Problem**: Workflows fail with authentication errors
- **Solution**: Verify token permissions and regenerate if needed
- **Check**: Token has `repo` and `workflow` scopes

#### **Project Board Not Updating**
- **Problem**: Issues not moving between columns
- **Solution**: Check project board workflow configuration
- **Check**: Workflows enabled in project settings

#### **Labels Not Applying**
- **Problem**: Automatic labeling not working
- **Solution**: Verify issue management workflow
- **Check**: Workflow file syntax and triggers

#### **Workflow Failures**
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions failing
- **Solution**: Check workflow logs for specific errors
- **Check**: Repository secrets and permissions

### **Support Resources**
- **GitHub Actions Logs**: Check workflow run logs
