# PSS Event System Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements to make the PSS event system more robust and add status mark functionality for recognized/unknown events.

## Current State Analysis

### Database Schema
- **PSS Events V2**: Main event storage with normalized relationships
- **PSS Event Details**: Flexible key-value storage for event-specific data
- **PSS Event Types**: Normalized event type definitions
- **PSS Matches**: Match information and configuration
- **PSS Athletes**: Athlete information and relationships
- **PSS Scores**: Score tracking per match/round
- **PSS Warnings**: Warning/gam-jeom tracking

### Current PSS Event Types Supported
- Points events (pt1, pt2)
- Hit level events (hl1, hl2)
- Warnings/Gam-jeom events (wg1, wg2)
- Injury time events (ij0, ij1, ij2)
- Challenge/IVR events (ch0, ch1, ch2)
- Break events (brk)
- Winner rounds events (wrd)
- Final winner events (wmh)
- Athlete events (at1, at2)
- Match configuration (mch)
- Scores (s11, s21, s12, s22, s13, s23)
- Current scores (sc1, sc2)
- Clock events (clk)
- Round events (rnd)
- System events (pre, rdy)

## Enhancement Plan

### 1. Add Status Mark System

#### 1.1 Database Schema Changes
- Add `recognition_status` field to `pss_events_v2` table
- Add `pss_event_recognition_history` table for tracking status changes
- Add `pss_unknown_events` table for collecting unrecognized events

#### 1.2 Status Mark Values
- `recognized`: Event is fully understood and parsed correctly
- `unknown`: Event format is not recognized
- `partial`: Event partially parsed but some fields unknown
- `deprecated`: Event type is no longer used in current protocol

#### 1.3 Recognition History Tracking
- Track when events change status
- Store raw data for unknown events
- Enable future protocol updates to recognize previously unknown events

### 2. Enhanced Event Validation

#### 2.1 Protocol Compliance Checking
- Validate event format against PSS v2.3 specification
- Check required vs optional fields
- Validate data types and ranges
- Flag events that don't match expected patterns

#### 2.2 Data Integrity Checks
- Validate athlete references exist
- Check match state consistency
- Verify score calculations
- Ensure temporal consistency

### 3. Robust Error Handling

#### 3.1 Graceful Degradation
- Continue processing even with malformed events
- Store raw data for all events regardless of parsing success
- Provide detailed error messages for debugging
- Implement retry mechanisms for database operations

#### 3.2 Error Classification
- `parsing_error`: Event format not recognized
- `validation_error`: Event violates protocol rules
- `data_error`: Invalid data values
- `system_error`: Database or system issues

### 4. Enhanced Event Details

#### 4.1 Comprehensive Event Metadata
- Processing time tracking
- Protocol version used for parsing
- Parser confidence scores
- Validation results
- Error details for failed events

#### 4.2 Hit Level Integration
- Link hit levels with point events
- Store hit level statistics
- Track hit level trends
- Enable performance analysis

### 5. Database Optimizations

#### 5.1 Performance Improvements
- Add composite indexes for common queries
- Optimize event detail storage
- Implement efficient event retrieval
- Add database maintenance procedures

#### 5.2 Data Management
- Implement event archiving
- Add data retention policies
- Create backup and recovery procedures
- Optimize storage usage

### 6. Protocol Evolution Support

#### 6.1 Future-Proof Design
- Extensible event type system
- Version-aware parsing
- Backward compatibility
- Protocol migration tools

#### 6.2 Unknown Event Collection
- Store all unrecognized events
- Enable pattern analysis
- Support protocol updates
- Provide debugging information
