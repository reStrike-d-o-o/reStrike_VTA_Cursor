**üìù Note**: This frontend implementation provides a complete, production-ready interface for the reStrike VTA project. All components are fully functional and ready for integration with the backend services.

**üîÑ Last Updated**: $(date)
**üë§ Developed by**: AI Assistant
**‚úÖ Status**: Complete and Ready for Testing 

## 2024-Atomic Component Reorganization

- All components in `ui/src/components/` were audited and categorized as atoms, molecules, organisms, or layouts.
- Each component was copied to a `.copy.tsx` file before any move or deletion, per project rules.
- Components were moved to their respective atomic folders: `atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`, `layouts/`.
- All imports throughout the codebase were updated to reference the new locations.
- All original root-level component files were deleted after verification.
- The application was tested and confirmed working after the reorganization.
- See also: updates in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, LIBRARY_STRUCTURE.md, and ui-design-document.md. 

## Atomic Extraction Progress (2024)
- Button, Input, Checkbox, Label atoms: Extracted and integrated.
- Badge/StatusDot atom: Extracted and all status indicators replaced.
- Icon atom: Extracted and all emoji/icon usages replaced.
- All accessibility linter issues (form/select labeling) fixed as of this update. 

## OBS WebSocket v5 Event Handling (Backend)

- The backend emits all official OBS WebSocket v5 event types as `ObsEvent::Raw`.
- Unknown or future event types are also handled generically, so the frontend can subscribe to and handle any event type.
- Detailed frontend handling can be added incrementally for any event type as needed. 

## OBS WebSocket Runtime Connection Management

- The backend supports runtime add/remove of OBS connections via Tauri commands (`add_obs_connection`, `remove_obs_connection`).
- The frontend can add or remove connections dynamically and receive events for each connection by name. 

## OBS WebSocket Command Sending

- The backend supports sending commands to OBS via a Tauri command (`obs_send_request`).
- The frontend can control any connected OBS instance and receive responses for each command. 

## AdvancedPanel Drawer-Based UI (2024-06)
The AdvancedPanel now uses a drawer-based UI:
- **Left Sidebar:** Vertical icon list for drawers: PSS, OBS, Video, AI Analyzer, Settings
- **Right Content Area:** Shows content for the selected drawer
- **Drawers:**
  - PSS: UDP server, PSS protocol, event DB
  - OBS: Connection management, options
  - Video: mpv integration
  - AI Analyzer: Report creation, data analyzer
  - Settings: All settings, including Diagnostics & Logs Manager

This modular structure allows for easy expansion and clear separation of advanced features.
