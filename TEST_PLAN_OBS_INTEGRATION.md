# OBS WebSocket Integration Test Plan

## üéØ Test Objectives

This test plan covers the complete OBS WebSocket integration functionality, with special focus on the recently implemented disconnect functionality and TypeScript error fixes.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Test Checklist

- [x] TypeScript errors fixed in WebSocketManager.tsx
- [x] Development server running (Tauri + React)
- [x] OBS Studio available for testing (optional)
- [x] Network connectivity confirmed

## üß™ Test Cases

### 1. Connection Management Tests

#### 1.1 Add New Connection
**Objective**: Verify ability to add new OBS connection configuration
**Steps**:
1. Open WebSocket Manager
2. Click "Add Connection"
3. Fill in connection details:
   - Name: "TEST_OBS"
   - Host: "localhost"
   - Port: 4455
   - Password: (leave empty or test with password)
   - Enabled: true
4. Click "Save Connection Settings"
**Expected Result**: Connection appears in list with "Disconnected" status

#### 1.2 Edit Existing Connection
**Objective**: Verify ability to edit connection settings
**Steps**:
1. Select existing connection
2. Click "Edit" button
3. Modify connection details
4. Click "Save Connection Settings"
**Expected Result**: Connection updated without losing configuration

#### 1.3 Save Settings vs Connect
**Objective**: Verify clear separation between saving settings and connecting
**Steps**:
1. Add/edit connection
2. Click "Save Connection Settings" (should not connect)
3. Verify status remains "Disconnected"
4. Click "Connect" button
**Expected Result**: Settings saved separately from connection action

### 2. Disconnect Functionality Tests

#### 2.1 Basic Disconnect
**Objective**: Test disconnect button functionality
**Steps**:
1. Connect to OBS (if available)
2. Click "Disconnect" button
3. Verify status changes to "Disconnected"
**Expected Result**: Connection properly closed, status updated

#### 2.2 Disconnect Without Connection
**Objective**: Test disconnect when not connected
**Steps**:
1. Ensure no active connection
2. Click "Disconnect" on any connection
**Expected Result**: No error, status remains "Disconnected"

#### 2.3 Configuration Preservation
**Objective**: Verify configuration is preserved after disconnect
**Steps**:
1. Connect to OBS
2. Disconnect from OBS
3. Verify connection still appears in list
4. Verify connection details are unchanged
**Expected Result**: Configuration preserved, only connection state changed

#### 2.4 Multiple Disconnects
**Objective**: Test multiple disconnect operations
**Steps**:
1. Connect to OBS
2. Disconnect multiple times
3. Verify no errors or duplicate operations
**Expected Result**: Clean disconnect operations, no errors

### 3. Error Handling Tests

#### 3.1 Invalid Connection Details
**Objective**: Test with invalid host/port
**Steps**:
1. Add connection with invalid host (e.g., "invalid-host")
2. Try to connect
**Expected Result**: Appropriate error message, status shows "Error"

#### 3.2 OBS Not Running
**Objective**: Test when OBS is not available
**Steps**:
1. Ensure OBS is not running
2. Try to connect to localhost:4455
**Expected Result**: Connection timeout or error, status shows "Error"

#### 3.3 Network Issues
**Objective**: Test with network connectivity problems
**Steps**:
1. Disconnect network (if possible)
2. Try to connect to remote OBS
**Expected Result**: Network error, appropriate error message

### 4. TypeScript and Code Quality Tests

#### 4.1 TypeScript Compilation
**Objective**: Verify no TypeScript errors
**Steps**:
1. Run `npm run build` in ui directory
**Expected Result**: Successful compilation, no errors

#### 4.2 Null Safety
**Objective**: Verify null checks are working
**Steps**:
1. Test all functions with null/undefined values
2. Verify no runtime errors
**Expected Result**: Proper null handling, no crashes

### 5. Integration Tests

#### 5.1 Full Workflow
**Objective**: Test complete connection workflow
**Steps**:
1. Add connection
2. Save settings
3. Connect to OBS
4. Verify status updates
5. Disconnect from OBS
6. Remove connection
**Expected Result**: Complete workflow works without errors

#### 5.2 Status Updates
**Objective**: Verify real-time status updates
**Steps**:
1. Connect to OBS
2. Monitor status changes
3. Verify UI updates reflect backend state
**Expected Result**: Status updates in real-time
